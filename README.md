# GroupRides by Jaden Kyler-Wank and Peter Shin

Created to alleviate the stress of getting large carpools organized, GroupRides is a cross between Facebook groups/Groupme chats/Uber so you never have to wonder how you’re getting somewhere ever again. Users can create or join organizations they’re a part of, as well as invite friends to their organizations via username. Every organization will have the ability to create an upcoming “event” where org members can elect to be either drivers or riders. For example, a church group could make an “event” for driving members to services. The “event” can be as formal or informal as necessary, with something like offering to drive to Cookout for friends in your organization.
